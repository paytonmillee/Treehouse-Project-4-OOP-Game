this is my version of the OOP phrase game. The challenges I had through out this course were a doozy. My main cause of being stuck was the reset of the game board.
the object of the game is to choose the correct letter of the phrase provided. If wrong letter is chosen then lives begin to go away until all lives are completely erased. If you successfully get through a phrase with all or some lives left you win the game.
